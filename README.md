# Lending Club Case Study

Lending club a finance company which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers.
When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
•If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
•If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

## Objective

The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default (loan_status = 'Charged Off'), i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment
